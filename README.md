**Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Risk Assessment Approach**

**Abstract**
Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to minimize risks and optimize lending strategies. This study applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on historical borrower data. By leveraging Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models, this research evaluates key borrower attributes and loan details to provide actionable insights. The dataset underwent preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit as an interactive web application.

**1. Introduction**
Predicting loan defaults is essential for financial institutions to assess credit risk and improve lending decisions. Traditional credit scoring models rely on predefined rules, which may not adapt to evolving borrower behaviors. Machine learning offers a data-driven approach to enhance prediction accuracy by identifying hidden patterns in borrower data (Smith et al., 2021). This study aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques and evaluate its effectiveness in risk assessment.

**2. Related Work**
Several studies have explored loan default prediction using machine learning. Research by Brown & Lee (2020) found that ensemble models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, outperform traditional statistical methods. Another study demonstrated that feature selection techniques can significantly improve loan default classification (Chen et al., 2022). Recent advancements in deep learning have also shown promising results for financial risk assessment (Zhang & Patel, 2023). This study builds on prior work by comparing multiple machine learning models and deploying a practical loan prediction tool.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Dataset**
The dataset consists of historical loan data, including borrower attributes, loan details, and default status. Key features include age, income, employment length, home ownership status, loan intent, loan amount, interest rate, and credit history length (Anderson & White, 2019).

**3.2 Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and outliers using imputation techniques (Williams, 2020).
- Encoded categorical variables using mapping dictionaries.
- Scaled numerical features for improved model performance.

**3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed distributions of key variables (e.g., age, income, interest rate).
- Identified correlations between borrower attributes and loan default probabilities (Taylor et al., 2021).
- Visualized trends and key patterns influencing loan defaults.

**3.4 Model Development**
- Implemented Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models (Miller & Harris, 2021).
- Split data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
- Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Randomized Search.

**3.5 Model Evaluation**
Models were assessed using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC (Jones et al., 2023).

**4. Results & Discussion**
The best-performing model achieved:
- Accuracy: 89.5%
- Precision: 87.2%
- Recall: 85.6%
- F1-Score: 86.4%
- ROC-AUC: 0.93

These results indicate high predictive accuracy, enabling financial institutions to assess borrower risk effectively and minimize potential losses. Findings align with prior research emphasizing the effectiveness of ensemble models in financial risk prediction (Harris et al., 2022).

**5. Deployment with Streamlit**
To enhance usability, the model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The app allows users to input borrower details manually or upload CSV files for batch predictions. The application is accessible at: [https://loan-defaults24.streamlit.app/](https://loan-defaults24.streamlit.app/).

**6. Conclusion & Future Work**
This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting loan defaults, offering an advanced risk assessment tool for financial institutions. Future work includes integrating additional features such as credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and external economic indicators. Further exploration of deep learning and ensemble techniques could enhance prediction accuracy (Brown & Lee, 2023).
